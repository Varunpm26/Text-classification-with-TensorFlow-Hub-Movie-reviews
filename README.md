# Text-classification-with-TensorFlow-Hub-Movie-reviews

This notebook classifies movie reviews as positive or negative using the text of the review. This is an example of binary—or two-class—classification, an important and widely applicable kind of machine learning problem.

The tutorial demonstrates the basic application of transfer learning with TensorFlow Hub and Keras.

We'll use the IMDB dataset that contains the text of 50,000 movie reviews from the Internet Movie Database. These are split into 25,000 reviews for training and 25,000 reviews for testing. The training and testing sets are balanced, meaning they contain an equal number of positive and negative reviews.

This notebook uses tf.keras, a high-level API to build and train models in TensorFlow, and TensorFlow Hub, a library and platform for transfer learning. For a more advanced text classification tutorial using tf.keras, see the MLCC Text Classification Guide.
